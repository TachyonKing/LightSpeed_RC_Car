# LightSpeed_RC_Car
 An open source remote control car made mostly using a 3D printer and online machining service (SendCutsSend or Fabworks).

3D models and other files will be released to this repository when the first version is ready for production.

Additionally, I might make a guide/manual to make building it easier, so stay tuned.
